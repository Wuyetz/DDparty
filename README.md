# DDparty
Written in javascript (some jquery was added later), html and css.
Creates random names (by combining syllables that fit into fantasy world) for Dungeons & Dragons party of four (two males and two females), 
their classes, alignments and races. You can additionally reroll every aspect of each character or reset the whole thing.
Check out notes in javascript file to get a better grasp of how I made it work, or check it out in action at :
