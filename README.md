Dungeons and Dragons random party name,class,race and alignment generator

Written in javascript with jquery, html and css.

Creates random names (by combining syllables that fit into fantasy world) for Dungeons & Dragons party of four (two males and two females), their classes, alignments and races. 

You can additionally reroll every aspect of each character or reset the whole thing.

Download it as zip file, extract it to folder of your choosing and click "open with.." on "index" file and choose your internet browser to open it (I tested it on Google Chrome Version 67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (64-bit))
